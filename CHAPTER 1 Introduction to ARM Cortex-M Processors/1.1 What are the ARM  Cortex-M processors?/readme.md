<h3>1.1.1 The Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 processors</h3> 
<p>32-bit architecture. The Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) is called the Thumb ISA and is based on Thumb-2 Technology which supports a mixture of 16-bit and 32-bit instructions.</p>
<p>The Cortex-M3 and Cortex-M4 processors have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Three-stage pipeline design</li>
  <li>Harvard bus architecture</li>
  <li>32-bit addressing, supporting 4GB of memory space</li>
  <li>On-chip bus interfaces based on ARM AMBA</li>
  <li>NVIC (Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller) up to 240 interrupt requests and from 8 to 256 interrupt priority levels</li>
  <li>Support for various features for OS: SysTick timer, shadowed stack pointer</li>
  <li>Low power features</li>
</ul>
